     1	LIKABLE
     2	DEB OLIN UNFERTH
     3	from NOON, issue 12
     4	She could see she was becoming a thoroughly unlikable
     5	person. Each time she opened her mouth she said
     6	something ugly, and whoever was nearby liked her a
     7	little less. These could be strangers, these could be
     8	people she loved, or people she knew only slightly
     9	whom she had hoped would one day be her friends. Even
    10	if she didn't say anything, even if all she did is
    11	seem a certain way, have a look on her face, or make a
    12	soft sound of reaction, it was always unlikable—except
    13	in the few cases that she fixed herself on being
    14	likable for the next four seconds (more than that was
    15	impossible) and sometimes that worked, but not always.
    16	white Why couldn't she be more likable? What was the
    17	problem? Did she just not enjoy the world anymore? Had
    18	the world gotten away from her? Had the world gotten
    19	worse? (Maybe, probably not. Or probably in some ways
    20	but not in the ways that were making her not like it).
    21	Did she not like herself? (Well, of course she didn't,
    22	but there was nothing new in that.)
    23	white Or had she become less likable simply by growing
    24	older—so that she might be doing the same thing she
    25	always did, but because she was now forty-one, not
    26	twenty, it had become unlikable because any woman
    27	EXTRA STRING WITH DAY
    28	doing something at forty-one is more unlikable than a
    29	woman doing it at twenty? And does she sense this?
    30	Does she know she is intrinsically less likable and
    31	instead of resisting, does she lean into it, as into a
    32	cold wind? Maybe (likely) she used to resist, but now
    33	she sees the futility, so each morning when she opens
    34	her mouth she is unlikable, proudly so, and each
    35	evening before sleep she is unlikable, and each Day it
    36	goes on this way, she getting more unlikable by the
    37	hour, until one morning she will be so unlikable,
    38	inconveniently unlikable, that she will have to be
    39	shoved into a hole and left there.
